- 👋 Hi, I’m @DurairajShyam
- 👀 I’m interested in anything to do with aerospace and in general, things that go fast, like Formula 1 or MotoGP!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and developing my understanding of aerodynamic flows and CFD approaches to study the drag-reducing effect of riblets. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any cool aeronautical, space or motorsport related projects...
- 📫 How to reach me: keen to connect on LinkedIn ;)
